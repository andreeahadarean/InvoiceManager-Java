# Invoice Manager
### Usage
The program was implemented using the IntelliJ as an IDE and Windows 10 as an operating system. It can be run from the user interface of the IDE or from the console. 
After running the program, the user will have to choose if he wants to use the persisted data or generate a new set of data and then click the "Start" button.
If he chooses to use the persisted data, the main menu will be displayed. From there, he can decide which operation he wants to perform. For each operation, a new frame will be shown, where the user must input the required information and the results will be displayed in the same frame. 
If the user chooses to generate a new set of data, a new frame will be opened. There he can decide if he wants to generate new data from the default data, as presented in the requirements of the project (the given strings, 24 companies, 48 products and 50 invoices), or generate a new set based on his needs. For any of the three objects, he can decide if he needs to use the default values or input new ones. After clicking the "Done" button, the main menu will be displayed and he can perfom any operation he wants. 
The program stops when the user exits the main menu.
